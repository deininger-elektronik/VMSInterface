### Writing a keycombinations_dict.py

The keycombinations_dict.py file is used to define key combinations and sequences that can be executed by a Python application. This file uses a dictionary structure to map command names to lists of key actions. Each key action can include pressing a key, holding a combination of keys, and waiting for a specified duration.

#### Keycodes Dictionary

The keycodes_dict.py file contains a dictionary that maps key names to their corresponding virtual key codes. These key codes are used by the Windows API to simulate key presses.

#### Key Combinations Dictionary

The keycombinations_dict.py file defines the key combinations and sequences. Each command is associated with a list of actions. Each action can be one of the following types:

1. **Press**: Simulates pressing and releasing a single key.
2. **Combination**: Simulates pressing and holding multiple keys simultaneously.
3. **Wait**: Specifies a delay in seconds before the next action.
4. **Keep Pressed**: Simulates holding down a key until explicitly released.

Here is an example of the keycombinations_dict.py:

```python
keycombinations = {
    "escCommand": [
        {"press": "Esc", "wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"},
    ],
    "CopyCommand": [
        {"combination": ["Strg", "C"], "wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"}
    ],
    "selectAComand": [
        {"press": "A"},
        {"wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"},
        {"press": "1", "wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"},
        {"press": "Enter", "wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"}
    ],
}
```

#### Explanation of Commands

1. **Press Command**:
    - `"press": "Esc"`: This action simulates pressing and releasing the "Esc" key.
    - `"wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"`: This action waits for the duration specified by the `WAIT_AFTER_KEY` variable before proceeding to the next action.

2. **Combination Command**:
    - `"combination": ["Strg", "C"]`: This action simulates pressing and holding the "Strg" (Ctrl) key and the "C" key simultaneously.
    - `"wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"`: This action waits for the duration specified by the `WAIT_AFTER_KEY` variable before proceeding to the next action.

3. **Sequence Command**:
    - `"press": "A"`: This action simulates pressing and releasing the "A" key.
    - `"wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"`: This action waits for the duration specified by the `WAIT_AFTER_KEY` variable.
    - `"press": "1"`: This action simulates pressing and releasing the "1" key.
    - `"wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"`: This action waits for the duration specified by the `WAIT_AFTER_KEY` variable.
    - `"press": "Enter"`: This action simulates pressing and releasing the "Enter" key.
    - `"wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"`: This action waits for the duration specified by the `WAIT_AFTER_KEY` variable.

4. **Keep Pressed Command**:
    - `"keep_pressed": "Alt"`: This action simulates holding down the "Alt" key.
    - `"keep_pressed": "Release"`: This action releases any keys that are currently held down.

#### Tying It All Together

When the Python application receives a command, it looks up the corresponding key combination in the `keycombinations` dictionary. It then executes each action in the list sequentially. For example, if the application receives the command `"selectAComand"`, it will:

1. Press and release the "A" key.
2. Wait for the duration specified by `WAIT_AFTER_KEY`.
3. Press and release the "1" key.
4. Wait for the duration specified by `WAIT_AFTER_KEY`.
5. Press and release the "Enter" key.
6. Wait for the duration specified by `WAIT_AFTER_KEY`.

This structure allows for flexible and customizable key combinations and sequences that can be easily modified and extended.

### Explanation for `{"keep_pressed": "Alt"}`

The `{"keep_pressed": "Alt"}` command in the `keycombinations` dictionary is used to simulate holding down the "Alt" key. This can be useful for key combinations that require a key to be held down while other keys are pressed.

#### How It Works

1. **Command Structure**:
    - The command is represented as a dictionary with the key `"keep_pressed"` and the value `"Alt"`.
    - This indicates that the "Alt" key should be held down.

2. **Code Execution**:
    - When the application processes this command, it will look for the `"keep_pressed"` key in the `keystroke` dictionary.
    - If found, it will retrieve the virtual key code for the "Alt" key from the `keycodes` dictionary.
    - The application will then use the `win32api.keybd_event` function to simulate pressing and holding the "Alt" key.

3. **Releasing the Key**:
    - To release the key, you can use the command `{"keep_pressed": "Release"}`.
    - The application will iterate through the `keycombinations` dictionary to find any keys that are currently held down and release them using the `win32api.keybd_event` function with the `win32con.KEYEVENTF_KEYUP` flag.

#### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `{"keep_pressed": "Alt"}` command in the `keycombinations` dictionary:

*(The combination of ALT + TAB was chosen to illustrate the working procedure, but it does not make sense in the context of this Python application as it would switch applications in Windows, which is not properly implemented since the commands are targeted at a single Windows application.)*

```python
keycombinations = {
    "holdAltCommand": [
        {"keep_pressed": "Alt"},
        {"wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"},
        {"press": "Tab", "wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"},
        {"keep_pressed": "Release"}
    ],
}
```

In this example, the `holdAltCommand` will:
1. Hold down the "Alt" key.
2. Wait for the duration specified by `WAIT_AFTER_KEY`.
3. Press and release the "Tab" key.
4. Wait for the duration specified by `WAIT_AFTER_KEY`.
5. Release the "Alt" key.

### Explanation for Wait Command

There is no difference in the wait command whether you type:

```python
{"press": "A"},
{"wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"},
```

or

```python
{"press": "A", "wait": "WAIT_AFTER_KEY"},
```

Both structures achieve the same result. The `wait` command specifies a delay in seconds before the next action. In both cases, the application will:

1. Press and release the "A" key.
2. Wait for the duration specified by `WAIT_AFTER_KEY`.

The difference is purely in the formatting of the dictionary. The first format separates the `press` and `wait` actions into two dictionary entries, while the second format combines them into a single dictionary entry. Both formats are valid and will be processed in the same way by the application.
